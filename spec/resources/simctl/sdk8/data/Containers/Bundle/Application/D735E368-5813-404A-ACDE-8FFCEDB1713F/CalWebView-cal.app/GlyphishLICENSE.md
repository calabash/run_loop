The icons may not be used in any form of "easy app builder" tools or websites.

The icons may not be redistributed under any other license without expressed written permission.

Yes! Tattoo them on your arm, use them on your business cards. Do not resell them as icons or use them in app builder tools or templates.

ATTRIBUTION:

None required for use by you, your company, your clients. But if you'd like to spread the word by linking to Glyphish from your website, blogpost, Twitter or wherever, your kind words are much appreciated.
