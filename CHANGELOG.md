If you build run_loop from sources with bundler, you must run:

```
$ rake device_agent:expand
```

* Directory: rescue errors during skip check and File.size #598
* Directory: rescue ENOENT errors during skip check #597

### 2.3.0

This release contains a significant change - Simulators will not be
automatically be relaunched whenever
`Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher#relaunch` is called.  Instead, run-loop
will try to keep the simulator running as long as it appears to be
health.  This change is only for DeviceAgent test runs.  Tests that use
UIAutomation will continue to relaunch the simulator.

If you are on macOS Sierra or using Xcode >= 8.0, you are running
against DeviceAgent.  UIAutomation is only used on El Cap with Xcode <
8.0 and iOS < 10.

If your tests need the simulator to relaunch every time
`Launcher#relaunch` is called, you can pass the new `:relaunch_simulator =>
true` option.  This option is provided for backward compatibility.

### 2.1.0

This release fixes a bug that might put the iOS Simulator into a bad state.
An iOS Simulator could potentially have a .app installed in its directory
structure, but the app would not appear in Springboard or be detected by
simctl.  We have fixed the bug for Xcode 7.  There is no possible fix for
Xcode 6.  In order to ensure that your iOS Simulators are in a good shape we
recommend that all users run:

```
# Will take ~10 minutes depending on the number of installed simulators.
#
# Don't forget to run this on your CI machines.
#
# You only have to run this command once!
$ DEBUG=1 run-loop simctl doctor
```

I apologize for the inconvenience, this mistake is on me. -jjm
